==== Migration

Unfortunately `FaultTypeParserExtension` was previously built on a 'feature' that does not work when `bean-discovery-mode='annotated'` is used and it had issues. 
The previous automatic operation has been removed, instead - if you use your own `FaultType` in your project - you need to add a `ProjectFaultTypeProvider` class that implements the `IFaultTypeProvider` interface and returns the `IFaultType` enum.

.sample
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Coffee FaultType provider - provides every FaultType enumeration used in the project
 * 
 * @author tamas.cserhati
 * @since 2.5.0
 * @see FaultTypeParser
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class ProjectFaultTypeProvider implements IFaultTypeProvider {

    @Override
    public Collection<Class<? extends Enum>> faultTypeEnums() {
        return List.of(CoffeeFaultType.class, FaultType.class);
    }
}
----

FaultTypeParser is using this provider to resolve enums based on the error code text.
