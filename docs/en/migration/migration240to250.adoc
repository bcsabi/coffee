coff:ee v2.4.0 -> v2.5.0 migration description, news, changes

=== Global

ðŸ’¥ ***BREAKING CHANGE*** ðŸ’¥
```
Global change that coffee-bom was used to import coffee dependency on projects. This has been changed to coffee-bom-project.

You then need to import the project elements as follows:

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee</groupId>
        <artifactId>coffee-bom-project</artifactId> <1>
        <version>${version.hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencyManagement>

This also means that the transparent dependencies that were previously put on projects from coffee-bom, are now removed.
Because of this, these dependencies will be reported as not found by maven, so they will need to be defined in the project using coffee.
```
