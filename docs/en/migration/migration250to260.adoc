coff:ee v2.5.0 -> v2.6.0 migration description, news, changes

== Global

=== Coffee BOM

ðŸ’¥ ***BREAKING CHANGE*** ðŸ’¥

[source,text]
----
Global change that coffee-bom was used to import coffee dependency on projects. This has been changed to coffee-bom-project.

You then need to import the project elements as follows:

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee</groupId>
        <artifactId>coffee-bom-project</artifactId> <1>
        <version>${version.hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencyManagement>

This also means that the transitive dependencies that were previously put on projects from coffee-bom, are now removed.
Because of this, these dependencies will be reported as not found by maven, so they will need to be defined in the project using coffee.

coffee-bom -> coffee-bom-project -re vÃ¡ltozott

* Jandex index config fix.

=== Hibernate

* Bump hibernate-core https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/releases/tag/6.1.5[6.1.5.Final] -> https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/releases/tag/6.2.13[6.2.13.Final]

==== Migration

* It is necessary to read the https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/6.2/migration-guide.adoc[Hibernate 6.2.x migration documentation] and update the affected parts of the project.
* The https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/6.2/migration-guide.adoc#timezone-and-offset-storage[Timezone and offset storage] now default to `DEFAULT`, therefore the time zones are also saved.
Since we haven't saved the time zone so far and the `BatchService` is also designed not to save, this is causing us problems.
To ensure that no time zones are saved, it is necessary to include the following property in `persistence.xml`: `<property name="hibernate.timezone.default_storage" value="NORMALIZE"/>`.
* The https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/6.2/migration-guide.adoc#bytecharacter-mapping-changes[Byte[+]+ and Character[+]+ types mapping changed].
The Byte[] types were handled until now, but due to hibernate changes, one of the following is required:
** Replace Byte[] with byte[]
** For the old behavior, it is necessary to enable the legacy array processing in the `persistence.xml` with the following property: `<property name="hibernate.type.wrapper_array_handling" value="legacy"/>`

== Changes

=== coffee-jpa

==== BatchService

* Based on the Hibernate 6.2.x changes, the `Insert`, `Update` and `Delete` SQL statements have been updated.
* Since Hibernate 6.2.x, the EnumType is deprecated, because they are processing enum values differently, so the handling of the EnumType in `BatchService` has been deleted.

==== Migration

Changes are backwards compatible doesn't need any migration.

==== JpaUtil

** Since Hibernate 6.2.x, the `JdbcSelect` class was renamed to `JdbcOperationQuerySelect`, and the `getSql()` method used from it to  `getSqlString()`, so we updated the `JpaUtil` with these changes.

==== Migration

Changes are backwards compatible doesn't need any migration.

==== Transactional annotation

In the  `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.jpa.annotation.Transactional` annotation the annotation @Stereotype has been removed and in @Target the annotation ElementType.TYPE too.

==== Migration

Changes are backwards compatible doesn't need any migration.

=== coffee-rest

* fix javax.annotation.processing.Processor file (rename back to javax.annotation.processing.Processor, because it hasn't changed to javax)

==== RequestVersionReader

RequestVersionReader has been rewritten. The stream mark() and reset() may have caused errors in some cases.

==== Migration

`IXmlRequestVersionReader` and `IJsonRequestVersionReader` have been removed, in case you used it update the interface to `IRequestVersionReader`.

==== Jsonb Config

Added the definition of the Jsonb configuration.

==== Migration

The changes do not result in migration work, backwards default values are set for correct usage.

=== coffee-module-mp-restclient

==== Jsonb Config

Added the definition of the Jsonb configuration.

==== Migration

The changes do not result in migration work, backwards default values are set for correct usage.

=== Coffee Quarkus Extensions

A new module called Coffee Quarkus extension has been created, which adds other elements needed for Quarkus to some of the coffee modules.
First element is coffee-module-mp-restclient-extension
Second element is coffee-deltaspike-data-extension

=== coffee-deltaspike-message

* Changed the pacakage of `org.apache.deltaspike.core.util` to `org.apache.deltaspike.core.util.message`, since 2 separate modules have the same original package, which is sensitived by Quarkus.

==== Migration

* `org.apache.deltaspike.core.util.ClassUtils` -> `org.apache.deltaspike.core.util.message.ClassUtils`
* `org.apache.deltaspike.core.util.PropertyFileUtils` -> `org.apache.deltaspike.core.util.message.PropertyFileUtils`

==== coffee-module-csv

Added new methods for changing the csv format. For example csv separator, escape char.

==== Migration

Changes are backwards compatible doesn't need any migration.

=== coffee-model-base

* The `AbstractEntity.toString()` function uses the type of the property instead of the value in case of `java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.OutputStream`, `java.io.Reader` and `java.io.Writer`.
It used the value of the property in such cases, for e.g. it read the stream in case of logging.

==== Migration

Changes are backwards compatible doesn't need any migration.

=== coffee-rest

* The `XsdHelper` provides the opportunity to delete the schema and JAXB context cache.

==== Migration

Changes are backwards compatible doesn't need any migration.

=== coffee-module-redisstream

==== ConsumerLifeCycleManager

* If the `ConsumerLifeCycleManager.CONSUMER_COUNTER` less than one, the `ConsumerLifeCycleManager.SEMAPHORE.acquire();` call will be skipped in the `ConsumerLifeCycleManager.stop()` method so in those cases where the container didn't contain any consumer, for e.g. in tests, the shutdown phase won't be stacked.

==== Migration

Changes are backwards compatible doesn't need any migration.
